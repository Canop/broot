## Discuss Broot in a chat room

The best place to chat about broot, to talk about features or bugs, is the Miaou chat.

There's a dedicated room:

[![Chat on Miaou](https://miaou.dystroy.org/static/shields/room-en.svg?v=1)](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3490?broot) **broot**

If you're French speaking, you might prefer to directly come where other French speaking programmers hang:

## Issues

We use [GitHub's issue manager](https://github.com/Canop/broot/issues).

Before posting a new issue, check your problem hasn't already been raised and in case of doubt **please come first discuss it on the chat**.

## Contribute

**Broot** is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The current focus is linux+mac but we try to support windows too.

Before starting working on a Pull Request, please join the Miaou room to coordinate the developement. There are frequently several feature branchs waiting to be merged and adding some wild ones may make the process painful.

If you think you might help, as a tester or coder, you're welcome.

## This documentation...

... needs your help too.

Tell us what seems to be unclear or missing, what tricks should be added.

And if you have interesting screenshots telling a story, they might find their way into a new page too.
