[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Canop/broot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


!!! note "Windows users"
    broot may need additional rights at first use in order to write its configuration file.
	Some users on Windows also report problems with the colon; remember that a space can be used instead of a colon.
	You should also use a modern terminal, for example the [new Microsoft one](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

# Precompiled binaries

Binaries are made available at every release in [download](https://dystroy.org/broot/download).

The archives there contain precompiled binaries, as well as the licenses and other files.

You may also directly download the executable files below, depending on your system:

Shell completion scripts: [completion](https://dystroy.org/broot/download/completion)

All releases are also available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Canop/broot/releases).

When you download executable files, you'll have to ensure the shell can find them. An easy solution on linux is for example to put them in `/usr/local/bin`. You may also have to set them executable using `chmod +x broot`.

As I can't compile myself for all possible systems, you'll need to compile broot yourself or use a third-party repository (see below) if your system isn't in the list above.

# From crates.io

## Dependencies

You'll need to have the [Rust development environment](https://www.rustup.rs) installed and up to date.

The main cause of compilation error is an outdated rust compiler. Try updating it with `rustup update`.

You may also have problems compiling if you're missing dependencies. Here's how to install them on several distributions:

Debian, Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev -y
```

Fedora, Centos, Red Hat:

```bash
sudo dnf install libxcb -y
```

openSUSE:

```bash
sudo zypper --non-interactive install xorg-x11-util-devel libxcb-composite0 libxcb-render0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-xfixes0
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu --noconfirm libxcb
```

## Broot installation

Once you have rust and dependencies installed, use cargo to install broot:

```bash
cargo install --locked broot
```

or, for clipboard support:

```bash
cargo install --locked --features clipboard broot
```

# From source

As for installing from crates.io, you'll need [rust and other dependencies](#dependencies) first.

Fetch the [Canop/broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) repository, move to the broot directory, then run

```bash
cargo install --locked --path .
```

If you want a custom compilation, have a look at the [optional features documentation](https://github.com/Canop/broot/blob/main/features.md). The most common feature is the "clipboard" one:

```bash
cargo install --locked --features clipboard --path .
```

# Third party repositories

Those packages are maintained by third parties and may be less up to date.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/broot.svg)](https://repology.org/project/broot/versions)

## Homebrew

```bash
brew install broot
```

## MacPorts

```bash
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install broot
```

## Scoop

```bash
scoop install broot
```

## Alpine Linux

```bash
apk add broot
```

*note: broot package is available in Alpine 3.13 and newer*

## APT / Deb

Ubuntu and Debian users may use this apt repository: [https://packages.azlux.fr/](https://packages.azlux.fr/)

## NetBSD

```bash
pkgin install broot
```

## Gentoo Linux

```bash
emerge broot
```

# Reinstall

To reinstall, just change the executable.

It's always been compatible with the previous configuration files but if your previous installation is old (especially if it's pre 1.14), you might want to get the new [configuration files](https://github.com/Canop/broot/tree/main/resources/default-conf) which have more relevant sections.

The simplest solution is to remove your old configuration directory (or rename if you want to keep things) so that broot recreates it.

# After installation

Now you should

1. [install the br shell function](../install-br/)
2. have a look at the verbs.hjson configuration file, and especially setup the editor of your choice
