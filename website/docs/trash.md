## Commands

When broot is compiled with the `trash` feature enabled (which is done for Linux and Windows in standard distributions), some additional commands are available:

* `:trash` : move the selected file to the trash
* `:open_trash` : display the content of the trash
* `:restore_trashed_file` : restore the file to its original location
* `:delete_trashed_file` : irreversibly delete a file which is in the trash
* `:purge_trash` : irreversibly delete the whole content of the trash

`:restore_trashed_file` and `:delete_trashed_file` are only available when the trash content is displayed.
