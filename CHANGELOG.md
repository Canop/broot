- upgrade terminal-light to 1.0.1 for better recognition of background color on high precision color terminals
- in default configuration, ctrl-left never opens a panel to the left, as I think this was most often unwanted (one too many hit on cltr-left). It's possible to get the old behavior by binding ctrl-left to `:panel_left` instead of the new `:panel_left_no_open` internal.
- New escaping rules let you skip many `\`, especially when building regexes - See new rules at https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#escaping - Fix #592

Due to a technical problem, background color based skin selection is disabled on non linux systems.

### v1.14.0 - 2022-07-05
<a name="v1.14.0"></a>
#### Major Feature: imports
A configuration file can now import one or several other ones.
An import can have a condition on the terminal's background color, which makes it possible to import either a dark or a light theme depending on the current terminal settings.
You're also encouraged to split your configuration in several files, as is now done for the default configuration.

- `:input_clear` internal - Fix #24

<a name="v1.4.0"></a>
### v1.4.0 - 2021-05-11
- the default (non prefixed) search is now "path fuzzy" instead of "name fuzzy". You can still change the default mode and mode bindings in the config. This was done after a survey in chat.

You may add files to the staging area then apply a command on all of them. This new feature is described [here](https://dystroy.org/broot/staging-area).
Several verbs have been added. Type "stag" in help to see them and their keyboard shortcuts.

<a name="v1.2.10"></a>
### v1.2.10 - 2021-04-03
- fix shift based key shortcuts - Fix #363

- remove diacritics and normalize unicode from input on fuzzy search (an unnormalized string with unwanted diacritics most often happen when you paste a string in the input)

<a name="v1.2.8"></a>
### v1.2.8 - 2021-03-11
- it's possible to define several key shortcuts for a verb, using the "keys" property
- improvements of fuzzy matching

- clipboard features (copy and paste verbs) now work on Android/Termux (needs the Termux API to be installed)
- fix a compilation problem on non gnu windows - Thanks @Stargateur
- obey '--color no' even in standard application mode. In that case, automatically enable selection marks or you wouldn't know what line is selected

<a name="v1.2.5"></a>
### v1.2.5 - 2021-02-25
- fix style characters being written in `--no-style` mode - Fix #346
- replace `--no-style` with `--color` taking `yes`, `no` or `auto`, with detection of output being piped in `auto` mode (default). `--no-style` is still usable but it's not documented anymore - Fix #347
- fix wrong version number written in log file - Fix #349
- by default the number of panels is now limited to 2 (can be changed in conf with `max_panels_count`). The goal is to improve the global ergonomics for the most common (universal?) use case - Fix #345

<a name="v1.2.4"></a>
### v1.2.4 - 2021-02-14
- :line_down_no_cycle and :line_up_nocycle. They may be mapped instead of :line_up and :line_down when you don't want to cycle (ie arrive on top when you go down past the end of the tree/list) - Fix #344
- fix selected line number rendering in text preview

<a name="v1.2.3"></a>
### v1.2.3 - 2021-02-06
- special paths in "no-enter" or "hide" aren't counted when summing sizes or dates. It's a compromise: it makes all sums a little slower, especially if you have a lot of special paths or complex ones, but it allows skipping over the very slow disks and thus makes some cases much faster - Fix #331
- br fish shell function uses shell completion of broot
- tree height in `:pt` now applies even when there are more root items (thus truncating the tree) - Fix #341
- fix the F5 and F6 shortcuts (copy and move between panels) in the default configuration

<a name="v1.2.1"></a>
### v1.2.1 - 2021-01-27
- allow dashes instead of underscores in conf property names. This fixes a regression as "special-paths", "ext-colors" and "search-modes" were defined with a dash up to version 1.0.7. Now both spellings are OK - Fix #330
- fix some problems with paths containing spaces (regression since 1.1.11)- Fix #329

<a name="v1.2.0"></a>
### v1.2.0 - 2021-01-14

<a name="v1.1.11"></a>
### v1.1.11 - 2021-01-07
- fix handling of rules starting with '/' in the global gitignore - Fix #321
- alt-c now mapped to the new :copy_line verb which, when in tree, puts the selected path in the clipboard and, when in text preview, puts the selected text line in the clipboard - Fix #322
- it's possible to define verb execution patterns as arrays instead of simple strings, to avoid having to escape quotes - Fix #319

<a name="v1.1.10"></a>
### v1.1.10 - 2020-12-24
broot now accepts both TOML and Hjson files for configuration. Default is Hjson. I explain the change [here](https://dystroy.org/blog/hjson-in-broot/)

- sizes (and dates and counts) are progressively displayed

<a name="v1.0.7"></a>
### v1.0.7 - 2020-11-27

<a name="v1.0.5"></a>
### v1.0.5 - 2020-11-05
* in case of IO error when previewing a file, display the error instead of quitting
* fix regression related to display of texts with characters taking several columns
* preview now supports opening system files with size 0 (eg /proc "files")

<a name="v1.0.4"></a>
### v1.0.4 - 2020-10-22
* don't use absolute paths for built-in verbs
* fix freeze on circular symlink chains
* `:filesystems` (alias `:fs`) display all mounted filesystems in a filtrable view. You can enter to browse at the mount point (unix only for now)
* `:toggle_root_fs` (alias `:rfs`) toogles showing information on the filesystem of the current directory
* filesystem information (mainly size and usage) related to the current filesystem displayed in whale-spotting mode

<a name="v1.0.3"></a>
### v1.0.3 - 2020-10-07

<a name="v0.19.0"></a>
### v0.19.0 - 2020-07-16
#### Major feature: the preview panel
Hit ctrl-right when a file is selected and you get the preview.

Column order is now configurable - Fix #127

<a name="v0.18.0"></a>
### v0.18.0 - 2020-06-26

#### Major change: Recursive last modified date computation
The date of directories is now the modification date of the last modified inner file, whatever its depth. This is computed in the background and doesn't slow your navigation.

#### Major change: Sort mode
Size can now be displayed out of sort mode, which concerns either size or dates.

There are new launch arguments:
* `--sort-by-count` : sort by number of files in directories
* `--sort-by-date` : sort by dates, taking content into account (make it easy to find deep recent files)
* `--sort-by-size` : sort by size
* `--whale-spotting` or `-w` : "whale spotting" mode (sort by size and show all files)

The `-s` launch argument now works similarly to -d or -p : it doesn't activate a sort mode but activates showing the sizes. `-s` has been replaced with `-w`.

Similarly new verbs have been defined:
* `:toggle_counts`, with shortcut `counts` shows the number of files in directories
* `:toggle_sizes`, with shortcut `sizes` shows the sizes of files and directories
* `:sort_by_count` has for shortcut `sc`
* `:sort_by_date` has for shortcut `sd`
* `:sort_by_size` has `ss` as shortcut
* `:no_sort` removes the current sort mode, if any

<a name="v0.17.0"></a>
### v0.17.0 - 2020-06-21
#### Major feature: keep broot open behind terminal editors
If you now open vi or emacs from broot with `leave_broot = false` you should

For example:
* `!/txt$/` : files whose name doesn't end in "txt"
* `carg|c/carg` : files whose name or content has "carg"
* `(json|xml)&c/test` : files containing "test" and whose name fuzzily contains either "json" or "xml"
The document contains other examples and precisions.

<a name="v0.15.1"></a>
### v0.15.1 - 2020-06-12
- fix some problems related to relative paths in built in cp and mv

<a name="v0.15.0"></a>
### v0.15.0 - 2020-06-12
#### Major feature: new input syntax - Breaking Change
New search modes (see https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#the-filtering-pattern) :
	- fuzzy or regex on sub-paths (the path starting from the displayed root)
	- search in file content
- it's possible to configure how search modes are selected in config
- search pattern characters can be escaped with a '\'
#### Minor changes:
- tab goes to next direct match when there's no verb in input - Fix #234
- `:open_stay_filter` to be used if you want to keep the pattern when you navigate - Fix #240
- mouse capture can be disabled with `capture_mouse = false` - Fix #238
- several small fixes

<a name="v0.14.2"></a>
### v0.14.2 - 2020-06-01

<a name="v0.14.1"></a>
### v0.14.1 - 2020-05-29
- fix uppercase letters ignored in input field

<a name="v0.14.0"></a>
### v0.14.0 - 2020-05-29
#### Major feature: `:focus` verb
This verb can be called, and parameterized, with a path as argument, which makes it possible to have a shortcut to a specific location.
As a result, the specific `:focus_user_home` and `:focus_root` verbs have been removed (`:focus ~` works on all OS).
#### Major feature: panels!
There are three major ways to open a new panel:
- by using ctrl-left or ctrl-right, which can also be used to navigate between panels
- when a verb is edited, by using ctrl-p, which opens a panel which on closure will fill the argument
- by using any verb with a bang. For example `:focus! ~` or `:!help`
When you have two panels, you may use some new verbs like :copy_to_panel which copies the selection to the selected location in the other panel.
Many new verbs and functions are related to panels but broot can still be used exactly as before without using panels.
#### Major feature: autocompletion
Using the Tab key you can complete verbs or paths
#### Major feature: special paths
Some paths can be handled in a specific way. Fix #205 and #208
You can for example decide that some slow disk shouldn't be entered automatically
#### Minor changes:
- date/time format configurable - Fix #229
- esc doesn't quit broot anymore (by popular demand)
It's probably a good idea to remove your existing conf.toml file so that broot creates a brand new one with suggestions of shortcuts.

### v0.13.0 - 2020-02-05
#### Major change: git related features
- `:show_git_file_info` compute git repo statistics and file statuses. Statistics are computed in background and cached.
- `:git_diff` verb launching `git diff {file}`
- `:git_status` filter files to show only the ones which are relevant for `git status` (warning: slow on big repositories)
#### Major change: rewamped launch flags
Several new launch flags have been added, mostly doing the opposite of previous ones (eg `-S` negates `-s`) and a new entry in the conf.toml lets you define default flags (which can be overridden by the ones you pass on the command line).
Do `br --help` to view the complete list of flags.
#### Minor changes:
- on refresh or after command, if the previously selected path can't be selected (missing file, probably) then the previous index will be kept if possible
- alt-enter can be rebinded (users should not do that without binding `:cd`, though)

<a name="v0.11.0"></a>
### v0.11.0 - 2019-12-21

<a name="v0.10.5"></a>
### v0.10.5 - 2019-12-20

<a name="v0.10.4"></a>
### v0.10.4 - 2019-12-16
* fuzzy search performance improvement
* verb invocation now optional so that a verb can be defined to just introduce a keyboard shortcut
* owner and group separately skinned
* screen redrawn on resize (but tree not recomputed, you may want to do F5 to have the best sized tree)
* changes in br shell function storage and sourcing from fish, bash, and zsh. Fixes #39 and #53.
Note that broot will ask you again to install the br function

<a name="v0.10.3"></a>

<a name="v0.10.1"></a>
### v0.10.1 - 2019-11-04
* incorporate crossterm 0.13.2 to fix a regression in vi launch (see https://github.com/Canop/broot/issues/73)

<a name="v0.10.0"></a>
### v0.10.0 - 2019-11-03
* moved to the crossterm 0.13 and termimad 0.7.1
* broot runs on stderr,
* broot can run in a subshell

Those changes allow tricks like `my_unix_command "$(broot)"` when you do `:pp` to print the path on stdout from broot

<a name="v0.9.6"></a>
### v0.9.6 - 2019-09-20
* smarter cut of the status line when it doesn't fit the console's width
* fix mouse click on the status line crashing broot
* prevent the best match from being hidden inside "unlisted" matches

<a name="v0.9.5"></a>
### v0.9.5 - 2019-09-15
* keyboard keys & shortcuts can be defined for more actions, all built-in verbs documented in website
* paths built from verb arguments are now normalized

<a name="v0.9.4"></a>
### v0.9.4 - 2019-09-13
New internal verbs like :focus_root, :focus_user_home, :refresh, :select_first
You can define triggering keys for verbs.

For example you can add those mappings:

	[[verbs]]
	invocation = "root"
	key = "F9"
	execution = ":focus_root"

	[[verbs]]
	invocation = "home"
	key = "ctrl-H"
	execution = ":focus_user_home"

	[[verbs]]
	invocation = "top"
	key = "F6"
	execution = ":select_first"

	[[verbs]]
	invocation = "bottom"
	key = "F7"
	execution = ":select_last"

Then, when doing <key>Ctrl-H</key>, you would go to you user home (`~` when on linux) and <key>F7</key> would select the last line of the tree.

A few more keys are defined as default, like F1 for `:help` and F5 for `:refresh`.

<a name="v0.9.3"></a>
### v0.9.3 - 2019-08-02
Launching broot with `--sizes` now sets a set of features enabling fast "whale spotting" navigation

<a name="v0.9.2"></a>
### v0.9.2 - 2019-07-31
Fix non consistent builds due to lack of precise versioning in crossterm subcrate versioning

<a name="v0.9.1"></a>
### v0.9.1 - 2019-07-29
#### Major change
* A new syntax allows specifying verbs which can work on relative paths or absolute paths alike.
For example the old definition of `cp` was

	invocation = "cp {newpath}"
	execution = "/bin/cp -r {file} {parent}{newpath}"

and it's now

	invocation = "cp {newpath}"
	execution = "/bin/cp -r {file} {newpath:path-from-parent}"

The :path-from-parent formatting means the token will be interpreted as a path, and if it's
not starting with a / will be prefixed by the parent path.
It's possible to also use `{subpath:path-from-directory}` where directory is parent only if
the selected file isn't a directory itself.
#### Minor changes
- shift-tab selects the previous match
- mouse wheel support (selection in tree, scroll in help)
- the input field handles left/right arrow keys, home/end, click, and delete

<a name="v0.9.0"></a>
### v0.9.0 - 2019-07-19
#### Major change
The logic behind opening has changed to allow easier opening of files in non terminal applications without closing broot.

**Old behavior:**
- in case of enter or double-click
   - on a directory: open that directory, staying in broot
   - on a file: open the file, quitting broot
- in case of alt-enter
   - on a directory: cd to that directory, quitting broot
   - on a file: cd to that file's parent directory, quitting broot

**New behavior:**
- in case of enter or double-click
   - on a directory: open that directory, staying in broot
   - on a file: open that file in default editor, not closing broot
- in case of alt-enter
   - on a directory: cd to that directory, quitting broot
   - on a file: open that file in default editor, quitting broot
#### Minor change
- Hitting `?` more directly opens the help screen, even when executing a verb

<a name="v0.8.4"></a>
### v0.8.4 - 2019-06-17
- apply verbs on link files, not on their targets (rm some_link was dangerous)

<a name="v0.8.3"></a>
### v0.8.3 - 2019-06-16
- mouse support: click to select, double-click to open

<a name="v0.8.2"></a>

- F5 refreshes the tree

<a name="v0.7.2"></a>
### v0.7.2 - 2019-03-15

- ctrl-u and ctrl-d are now alternatives to page-up and page-down
- better error messages regarding faulty configurations

### v0.5.0 - 2019-01-30
- patterns can be regexes (add a slash before or after the pattern)
- configuration parsing more robust
- no need to put all verbs in config: builtins are accessible even without being in config
- no need to type the entire verb shortcut: if only one is possible it's proposed
- verbs with {file} usable in help state: they apply to the configuration file
- clear in app error message when calling :cd and not using the br shell function
- bring back jemalloc (it's faster for broot)
- more precise display of file/dir sizes

### 0.4.7 - 2019-01-21
- fix some cases of panic on broot quitting
- new `--cmd` program argument allows passing a sequence of commands to be immediately executed (see [updated documentation](https://github.com/Canop/broot/blob/master/documentation.md#passing-commands-as-program-argument))
- better handling of symlink (display type of target, show invalid links, allow verbs on target)
- compiled with rustc 1.32 which brings about 4% improvements in perfs compared to 1.31
