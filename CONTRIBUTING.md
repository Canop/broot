Before you start, unless you're fixing a typo or proposing a trivial change, please

- discuss the need and technical design first, either in an issue or on [miaou](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3768)
- keep it simple and focused
- don't touch more files or lines than necessary
- apply the standard formatting of the project
- check tests

And remember: there's no problem in asking when not sure, even if somebody else may have asked before, we're humans.
