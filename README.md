An interactive tree view, a fuzzy search, a balanced BFS descent and customizable commands.

[Documentation](documentation.md)

### Get an overview of a directory, even a big one:

![overview](doc/20181215-overview.png)

Notice the "unlisted" ? That's what makes it usable where the old `tree` command would produce pages of output.

.gitignore files are properly dealt with to put unwanted files out of your way (you can ignore them, though, see documentation).

### Find a directory then `cd` to it:

![cd](doc/20181218-cd.png)

You can this way navigate to a directory with the minimum amount of keystrokes, even if you don't exactly remember where it is.

broot is fast and never blocks, even when you make it search a big slow disk (any keystroke interrupts the current search to start the following one).


Most useful keys for this:

* the letters of what you're looking for
* `<enter>` to select a directory (staying in broot)
* `<esc>` to get back to the previous state or clear your search
* `:c` to get back to the shell having cd to the selected directory ([see below](#use-broot-for-navigation))
* `:q` if you just want to quit (`<esc>` works too)

### See what takes space:

![size](doc/20181215-only-folders-with-size.png)

To toggle size display, you usually hit `:s`. Sizes are computed in the background, you don't have to wait for them when you navigate.

### Never lose track of file hierarchy while you fuzzy search:

![size](doc/20181215-search.png)

broot tries to select the most relevant file. You can still go from one match to another one using `<tab>` or arrow keys.

### Apply a personal shorcut to a file:

![size](doc/20181215-edit.png)

Just find the file you want to edit with a few keystrokes, type `:e`, then `<enter>` (you should define your prefered editor, see [documentation](documentation.md#verbs)).

## Installation

### From Source

You'll need to have the Rust development environment installed. Please read this [doc](https://dev.to/jonasbn/til-setting-up-a-rust-development-environment-2f95) to setup a rust environment.

Fetch the Canop/broot repository, move to the broot directory, then run

    cargo build --release

The executable is written in the `target/release` directory.

### From up to date precompiled binaries

* [x86_64-linux](https://dystroy.org/broot/x86_64-linux/broot)

## Configure broot for navigation

broot is convenient to find a directory then `cd` to it. The `c` command of the default configuration is here for this purpose.

But broot needs a companion function in the shell in order to be able to change directory. To enable this feature, add this to your `.bashrc` (or the relevant file for another shell):

	# start broot and let it change directory
	function br {
	    f=$(mktemp)

	    (
		set +e
		broot --out "$f" "$@"
		code=$?
		if [ "$code" != 0 ]; then
		    rm -f "$f"
		    exit "$code"
		fi
	    )
	    code=$?
	    if [ "$code" != 0 ]; then
		return "$code"
	    fi

	    d=$(cat "$f")
	    rm -f "$f"

	    if [ "$(wc -c <(echo -n "$d") | head -c1)" != 0 ]; then
		cd "$d"
	    fi
	}

(you'll have to source the file or open a new terminal)

With this addition, you can do just `br` to lauch broot, and typing `:c` then *enter* will cd for you. You can search and change directory in one command: `mylosthing:c`.


## Development

To ease tests during development, a log file can be generated (and followed using tail -f) by using the BROOT_LOG env variable.

For example:

    BROOT_LOG=debug cargo run

or

    BROOT_LOG=info cargo run

If you want to discuss the code or features of broot, please come to [our chat](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3?Code_et_Croissants). Before to start coding for a PR, it would really be a good idea to come and talk about it.

If you'd like a new feature, don't hesitate to ask for it.
