//! The goal of this mod is to ensure the launcher shell function
//! is available for fish and zsh i.e. the `br` shell function can
//! be used to launch broot (and thus make it possible to execute
//! some commands, like `cd`, from the starting shell.
//!
//!
//! In a correct installation, we have:
//! - a function declaration script in ~/.local/share/broot/launcher/fish/br/1.fish
//! - a link to that script in ~/.config/fish/conf.d/br.fish
//! (exact paths depend on XDG variables)
